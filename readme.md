This app is designed with individuals with ADHD in mind, who often benefit from visual and auditory reminders to maintain focus and productivity throughout the day.

## Usage

Upon launching the app, you'll see the settings interface where you can configure your messages, how often you see them, and how they display - and that's it! After that, your messages will periodically display on your screen.
